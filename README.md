Part_1 : implemented the VGG-13 (Version B) and applied it to solve an image dataset containing three classes: dogs, cars and food. got accuracy of 92.63 %â€¨using regularization.
Part_2 : implemented ResNet-18 by manually defining a residual block and applied it to solve the image dataset that we use in Part 1. The testing accuracy achieved is 87.93% and the testing loss is 0.4561.
Part_3 : worked on time-series forecasting using RNN and LSTM methods. best Mean Squared Error: 0.00022895804158631962, R^2 Score: 0.9982081559383736. Dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/360/air+quality
Part_4 : performed a sentiment analysis using LSTM model. The best accuracy achieved is 77.2% for the test data. Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment
